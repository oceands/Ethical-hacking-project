# Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks Showcase

## Overview
This project aims to explore and simulate various social engineering and phishing attacks to highlight their methods and impacts. By leveraging human trust and using reconnaissance tools, the project demonstrates three attack vectors: spear phishing, baiting with infected files, and water hole attacks. Each scenario showcases different strategies to gain unauthorized access and compromise security.

## Objectives
- Investigate human susceptibility to trust-based attacks.
- Use reconnaissance tools to gather target information.
- Simulate spear phishing to acquire credentials.
- Demonstrate baiting techniques with infected files.
- Implement a water hole attack to exploit website vulnerabilities.
- Analyze the effectiveness and risks associated with each attack vector.

## Features
- **Spear Phishing:** Targeted emails to deceive users into divulging credentials.
- **Baiting:** Use of infected files to lure victims into compromising their systems.
- **Water Hole Attack:** Exploitation of website vulnerabilities to gain system access.
- **Reconnaissance Tools:** Tools to gather information about targets before executing attacks.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory.


## Usage
1. Modify configurations and targets in the respective attack scripts.
2. Execute each attack scenario to observe the outcomes.
3. Analyze logs and outputs to understand attack effectiveness and risks.
4. Use caution and legal considerations in real-world scenarios.

## Requirements
- IDE (optional, for development)
- Internet access for reconnaissance tools
